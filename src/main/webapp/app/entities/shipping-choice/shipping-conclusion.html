			<b>Tracking Event Descriptions</b>
		</h2>
		<h4 class="top-buffer">Shipment movement information is captured
			each time a tracking label is scanned in our system, from the time
			the label is created until the shipment is delivered. Some of the
			scans and other events that occur throughout the shipment's journey
			are defined below. Shipments may travel through multiple facilities
			and by different modes of transportation, such as tractor-trailers,
			airplanes, trains, and ocean vessels.</h4>
		<h4>If your shipment is expected to be in transit for more than a
			day between tracking scans, we will display the day and date of the
			Next Expected Tracking Event in the Shipment Progress area. This
			message does not mean that your shipment is behind schedule or
			stopped moving; it simply means that the tracking label might not be
			scanned for a while. We display the Next Expected Tracking Event so
			you can rest assured that your shipment is still moving even though
			no new tracking scans may appear for a while.</h4>
